# Task details 


## Core requirements 

### Grid Layout:
●	Use React, Typescript, Tailwind CSS to design a fluid, responsive grid layout that supports a large number of data rows and columns.
●	Assume that the height of the grid container is known, each row has a fixed and uniform height, and the width of each column is predefined.

### Virtualization:
●	Implement a manual virtualization technique that renders only the currently visible rows (+ some buffer amount) based on the user's scroll position.

### User Interaction:
●	The user interface should be intuitive, allowing users to interact with the grid smoothly and efficiently.
●	The visual feedback during scrolling, data operations, and navigation should be clear and responsive to user actions.

### Performance:
●	Optimize for performance to handle a dataset of 10,000 records, ensuring minimal UI lag and swift rendering during operations.

### Bonus Points (not required):
●	Cells should be selectable using mouse clicks.

●	Implement keyboard navigation within the grid: users should be able to move between cells using Tab for horizontal navigation and Arrow keys for vertical navigation.
●	Allow users to perform sorting and filtering operations on the dataset.
